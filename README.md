- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhoDatChino aka Keano

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Where to start! My interest at the moment is focused on front end development. As I practise to improve my skills I am hoping to move more into the backend 
or maybe blend the two by doing fullstack. Knowledge base includes JS, HTML and CSS.
Interests outside of coding include the financial markets - due to my background in investment management. I strive to try and blend these first two interests together as much as
I can going forward because I know I can develope useful programs that can aid in financial analysis and investing.
Less formal interests include pixel art, sports (specifically soccer), and gaming

- 🌱 I’m currently learning - Development in React and advanced data structures and algorithms as I am always looking for new interesting ways to optimise the way I code

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source project. The more exposure the better!
